1. unique id for each every aircraft
2. update weather and changes to coordinates
3. the calling of the two methods of aircrafts
4* check HashMaps again "I might need to use them"

SIMULATION

step 1 - public void registerTower(WeatherTower weatherTower) {
        * get the weather from weatherTower.getWeather(coordinates)
        * update this.objects' coordinates
        * print the message 
        * use hashmaps for different outcomes
    }

    - create a file writer in the App.java and call it in the aircraft
    - NB the weather trigering loop should call weatherTower.changeWeather
    -
